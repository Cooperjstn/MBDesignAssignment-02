        <h1><ins>Mark Bolton Design</ins> & Monotype</h1>
        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p> Mark Boulton Design was a small design studio. In 2014,<span style=color:lightblue> we were acquired by Monotype</span>.
        Over the years, we <span style=color:lightblue>built an amazing team</span> and worked on some <span style=color:lightblue>tremendous projects with the smartest clients</span>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful for. But, it's time for change.</p>
        <p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems we want to fix. Mark Boulton Design is now closed. The team will be working on Monotype projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll still speaking at web conferences. We're not going anywhere.</p>
